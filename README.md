# test

Test repo for "overwrite" renaming.

The repository [You-are-the-best-and-I-like-you](https://github.com/doekman/You-are-the-best-and-I-like-you) was previously called `test` and before this repository ([the one you're looking at now](https://github.com/doekman/test)) was created, the link [test](https://github.com/doekman/test) redirected to [You-are-the-best-and-I-like-you](https://github.com/doekman/You-are-the-best-and-I-like-you). Not anymore...
